Elite Four Battle

In order to face off against the Elite Four, simply run “EliteFour.py”.
However, if you are feeling spicy, you can run the “EliteFour_Music.py” instead!
If you do not have a couple tiny modules installed though, there is a small barrier to entry.

To run that file, all that is required is:
    portaudio
    pyaudio

If you do not have them, just run in terminal:
    brew install portaudio
    pip install pyaudio

If you feel like this is too much trouble, you can just run “EliteFour.py” and will get the same
project, just more boring because no music.

Hope you have fun!
